# VisualAcuity
Part 3 Project: Creating a self adminstred Visual Acuity app on a mobile application 

Abstract
This paper develops and evaluates a prototype mobile application that can carry out a self-
administered visual acuity test. This will provide a potential solution to accessible eyes,
mainly in remote areas. Also, in work and everyday health management, at times which can
alleviate unneeded professional help. This prototype provides a very effective and user-
friendly tool for users to have a preliminary test for their eyes and seek professional
assistance based on the results. The study will, in its focus, use a comparative look at the
Snellen test tradition done in clinics to ensure that accuracy is met. Key functionalities
include automated calibration to gauge the distance from the device camera so that it can
tell if the user is positioned right for replicating the Snellen Test. The use of speech
recognition technology allows the user to answer the questions with no need for assistance
or help. The evaluation of the developed prototype pointed out that the application was
accurate, reliable, and underlined the essence of innovative solutions in the enhancement of
accessibility to public health
